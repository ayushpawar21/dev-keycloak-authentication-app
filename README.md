## Introduction

The Dev Keycloak Authentication App is designed to help developers integrate Keycloak into their applications for secure authentication and authorization. Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management solution aimed at modern applications and services.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control
- Integration with Keycloak for identity management
- Secure API endpoints

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed
- Docker installed (optional, for running Keycloak in a container)
- A Keycloak server instance (can be run locally using Docker)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ayushpawar21/dev-keycloak-authentication-app.git
    cd dev-keycloak-authentication-app
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up Keycloak:

    - If you don't have a Keycloak server running, you can start one using Docker:

        ```bash
        docker run -p 8080:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin jboss/keycloak
        ```

    - Access the Keycloak admin console at `http://localhost:8080` and create a new realm, client, and user.

4. Configure the application:

    - Update the Keycloak configuration in `keycloak.json` or environment variables as needed.

## Usage

1. Start the application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Log in using the credentials of the user created in the Keycloak admin console.

## Configuration

The application can be configured using a `keycloak.json` file or environment variables. Below is an example of a `keycloak.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "realm": "your-realm",
  "auth-server-url": "http://localhost:8080/auth",
  "ssl-required": "external",
  "resource": "your-client-id",
  "public-client": true,
  "confidential-port": 0
}
```
